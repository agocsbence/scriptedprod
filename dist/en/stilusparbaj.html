                <p>As Coco Chanel said: Fashion changes, but style endures, and who would question that? The reality show titled Style fight (Stíluspárbaj) with Márk Lakatos challenges wannabe fashion experts if they can find their way around clothes, shoes, accessories, and in the world of shopping generally. Everyone has a given amount of money they can spend, only luck decides who gets how much, and similarly to some of their shoes, the time limit is very tight. Rushing from one store to the other, frantically changing clothes, and desperately counting money at the check-out – and that is not all! The biggest challenge is that the rivals are watching through the cameras and they evaluate the shopping spree together with the completed outfit. Sometimes the nippy comments come with very low points as well.</p>
                <p>The competitors not only have to meet the expectations of each other, but of the weekly guest star and of Márk as well. The winner goes home, or rather to the mall, with a fashionably styled amount in the form of vouchers. In the second season, the stakes are much higher, as celebrities compare their sense of style. They don’t have an easier job, and sometimes Márk even introduces an unexpected twist. During the exciting competition one can learn countless fashion tips from the participants, and fortunately the stylist-guru doesn’t hide his wisdom either: he always gives generous advice to the viewers regarding the current tasks. This in itself makes it worth to take a look into the fashion battle. Made on behalf of Sony AXN Hungary.</p>
